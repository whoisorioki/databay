## TODO
Our dataset is ready for some analysis, but there are still some data cleaning tasks left! Here are your next steps:
 - Convert the price_euros column to a numeric dtype.
 - Extract the screen resolution from the screen column.
 - Extract the processor speed from the cpu column.

Here are some questions you might like to answer in your own time by analyzing the cleaned data:
 - Are laptops made by Apple more expensive than those made by other manufacturers?
 - What is the best value laptop with a screen size of 15" or more?
 - Which laptop has the most storage space?
 - The final lesson in our course is a guided project, where we'll put everything together to clean and analyze a dataset using pandas!
